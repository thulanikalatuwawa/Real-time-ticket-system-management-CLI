# Real-time-ticket-system-management-CLI
This Java-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application simulates a real-time ticket management system where vendors and customers interact with a shared ticket pool. Vendors periodically release tickets into the pool, while customers attempt to retrieve tickets based on configurable parameters.
